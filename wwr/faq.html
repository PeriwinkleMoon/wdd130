                        <p><b>Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages.</b> We have found however that children <b>over the age of 8 
                        seem to enjoy it more overall</b> (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8).<br><br>A common 
                        concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly 
                        we deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful 
                        in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things 
                        very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river guides are unable to 
                        go for very long at all without telling stories...some of which are even true!</p>

                        <p>As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides 
                        are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common 
                        injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.<br><br>
                        Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). Many non 
                        swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. <b>Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk before 
                        your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.</b></p>

                        <p>The most effective way to plan for temperature and weather changes in the Canyon is to be prepared for both hot & 
                        dry and cold & wet conditions. Here are some suggestions:
                        <li>Rain jacket and rain pants- do not bring ponchos!</li>
                        <li>Quick dry shirts and shorts, long sleeve cotton shirt and pants- helps keep you cooler on hot days.</li> 
                        <li>Button down shirts (Provide more sun protection on the neck)</li> 
                        <li>Light Weight Cotton Pant, Nylon Pant or Sarong</li>
                        <i>If you are cold natured, bring...</i>
                        <li>Polypropylene long underwear top and bottom</li><br>
                        
                        <b>Hats:</b> We suggest large brims that offer protection from the sun with a good quality strap.<br>
                        <b>Sunglasses:</b>Make sure they have a strap (So they don't fall off!)<br>
                        <b>Socks:</b> Socks used for hiking and to protect your feet from the sun.<br>
                        <b>Shoes:</b> Sandals or water shoes- if you're not used to hiking in these, bring a pair of shoes you have hiked in before.<br>
                        <b>Camper wear:</b> Bring something comfortable to wear around camp. Cotton dresses, skirts and sarongs are all popular options.<br>
                        <b>Sleep wear:</b> You might choose to sleep in your camp wear. Otherwise, you might like to bring something comfortable to sleep in.<br>
                        <br>
                        <li>Water bottle</li>
                        <li>Small day pack for hikes</li> 
                        <li>Moisturizing lotion</li>
                        <li>Headlamp or flashlight</li>
                        <li>Moleskin (No one likes blisters!)</li>
                        <li>Waterproof sunscreen and lip balm</li><br>

                        The best thing for men to wear are swim trunks as shorts!<br>
                        Women wear swim suits or quick dry underwear and sport bras as a base layer during the day. 
                        Over the base layer, wear a pair of quick dry shorts and the shirt of your 
                        choice (polypropylene if you are cold, cotton if you are hot). Two piece swim suits are convenient when changing or 
                        going to the bathroom.<br><br>
                        <b>Hygiene products:</b> toothpaste, toothbrush, tissue, nail clippers, feminine hygiene products, extra 
                        eyeglasses or contacts, biodegradable soap and shampoo<br>
                        <b>Some good optional items:</b> Gloves, fleece jacket, towel, 
                        bandana, small pillow, camera equipment, a book, watercolors, journal and pen.</p>

                        Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful starry sky. Have a hearty 
                        warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your things and prepare for the day. The day 
                        is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and more good food.<br>We 
                        try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or good company by the river, 
                        or explore around camp while your guides prepare your dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes, or grilled 
                        salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you won't forget the dutch oven brownies! After dinner it's more relaxing, and you 
                        might even be able to talk your guide into another story or two to send you off to bed under more stars than you thought 
                        were possible.</p>
