         <p>Hello, I'm Ella! I am just starting out my formal education and am marrying the love of my life in the temple this Friday on <br>
            September 15th! But even with everything going on this month, I'm excited to be learning with all of you this semester!
    
         <p>I was born in Arizona, my family being from Utah, and I've lived all over the United States, from Washington state, to South <br>
            Dakota to Virginia. Just to name a few. But I'm currently living in Northern Utah where I'm likely to stay until further notice.
         </p>
         <p>I have some experience with HTML because of experience with blogging websites, but I'm eager to learn how to do everything <br>
            properly,  gain a better understanding of HTML, and learn CSS for the first time! I'm planning to get my Associate's in Web <br>
            & Computer Programmig. I'm not quite sure what kind of career I want, or where my education will take me, but I'm excited<br>
            for whatever comes next!</p>
