        RAGTIME GALCATTY<br>
        Hello! I'm Ella Moon. A character design and illustration artist with a passion to create! I specialize in humanoids, furries or other anthropromorphic creatures, ponies, and quadrupeds like cats/dogs/rabbits/etc.<br>
        If you're looking for a reference for that new character in your story, an illustration of your Dungeons and Dragons character, or a new outfit or weapon for your favorite OC (just to name a few possibilites) - You've come to the right place!<br>
        <br>
        Whether you're looking for a little more of a detailed style...or a more cartoony and simplified style I am happy to oblige and bring your vision to life!<br>
        <br>
        Interested in my work? You can contact me at RagtimeGalcatty@gmail.com. Want to see more of my work? Visit my socials!<br>
        <br>
        <b>Just so you know...You might be looking for someone else if...</b><br>
        <b>X</b>  You want graphic design elements for your site, company, business, etc.<br>... (Logos, buttons, etc.)<br>
        <b>X</b>  You want want me to copy an existing style (especially one that falls outside my typical style)<b>*</b><br>... (eg. "Draw my OC in the Scott Pilgrim art style")<br>
        <b>X</b>  You want big, detailed scenery art, not focused on a character<br>... (eg. A painting of a valley, or an illustration of a city street.)<br>
        <b>X</b>  You want highly realistic drawings of people or things.<br>
        <i><b>*</b>This can be negotiated, and I may even enjoy the assignment! But I perfer to work in my own style, and if you expect a 100% faithful depiction of the source material, it might be best you look for someone else more specialized :)</i>

      <h3>ToS & Pricing</h3>
      <p>
        <b>TERMS OF SERVICE</b><br>
        POLICY - I reserve the right to turn down any commission for any reason. I also reserve the right to use all art created by me for the purposes of promoting my freelance work, (eg. Using as an example in my portfolio or posting to social media) unless the client asks otherwise.<br>
        COMMERCIAL VS PERSONAL USE<br>
        <i>Art commissioned for commercial use. (Eg. art for a published book, a mascot for a commercial venture, etc.)</i><br>
        The client retains the rights to the commissioned piece(s) over me, but all commercial commissions will be charged at a 20% increase from the standard price. If the client would like to use art previously commissioned for personal use in a new commercial venture, contact me RagtimeGalcatty@gmail.com, and we can come to a payment agreement.<br>
        WHAT I WILL NOT DRAW<br>
        <b>X</b> Porn or Suggestive Content: Explicit nudity, genitals, sexual scenes or imagery, suggestive poses/clothing. (Ask me if you are not sure)<br>
        <b>X</b> Offensive or Hateful Imagery: Hatespeech, racist imagery, etc. This also includes slurs, and most swear words, "flipping someone off". If you want me to draw a scene including a character swearing, the swear will be bleeped out.<br>
        <b>X</b> Extreme gore: Graphic gore such as visible internal organs. Ask me about this one! I'm generally pretty okay with drawing blood and injuries.<br>
        <br>
